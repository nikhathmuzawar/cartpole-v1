# cartpole-v1
Implement a reinforcement learning agent to solve the
CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI's Gym. Your task is to apply at least two
different RL algorithms—such as Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), or Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)—and compare their performance in balancing the pole.
Evaluate the agents based on their learning curves, average reward per episode, and
stability. Provide a detailed report including implementation details, results, and a
discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.
